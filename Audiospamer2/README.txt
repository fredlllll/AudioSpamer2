Audiospamer2 Readme

-howto use:
on the first startup you have to select your microphone and your sound output.
your microphone volume will be 0 on the beginning (there is a slider for this)
you can add spams using the button "add new spam"
double click a spam to play it.
and the rest is exploration :P

-known bugs:
	seems to have problems running in windows XP i dunno why. maybe the Bass.net lib causes these problems. i will not try to fix it. 

-reinstall
	just delete everything in the folder except
	AudioSpamer2.exe,
	AudioSpamer2.pdb,
	options.ini,			(these are the options. e.g. which sounddevices should be used, and where you left the volumes)
	spams.txt				(this is the list of all you spams you added to the audiospamer so far. if you delete it you can start over with adding spams)
	and then run AudioSpamer2.exe to download the latest version

-custom pictures
	wanna have custom pictures in the effects windows and/or the box with your spams?
	if you want a custom background for the effects:
	make a picture and save it as EffectsBG.png and place it in the audiospamer's folder. then run the audiospamer
	for the box with your spams: just name the file ListBG.png
